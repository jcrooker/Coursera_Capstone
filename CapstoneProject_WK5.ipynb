    "Entrepreneurs frequently make decisions regarding the launch of a new business without the availability of market demand information. The potential for superior returns exists for the entrepreneur if this new market contains customers and clients with pent up demand for the services and offerings of the business.  On the otherhand, the entrepreneur could lose her entire stake if demand for business offerings fails to materialize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hiring a consultant to conduct an extensive survey and evaluation of the potential business expansion is costly.  Further, the entrepreneur generally must identify a fairly precise physical location for the new business as well.  If the entrepreneur is open to a wide geographic location, costs frequently grow geometrically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate an empirical technique to assess the viability of new business in a market.  For concreteness, we will consider new business creation in two cities: (1) New York and (2) Toronto.  The algorithms can be applied to any city.  The machine learning (ML) technique will make a recommendation regarding the type of business to open and the location.  The techniques are described below in the Methodology section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML techniques presented in this analysis uses the existing market structure to assess the diversity and dispersion across a city.  The algorithms mathematically search for gaps by business types in geographic locations across a city.  These gaps in business type and location indicate areas in which pent up demand is likely to exist.  Another advantage of using these ML techniques are that they are relatively costless to employ relative to the formal market demand study and analysis.\n"

    "To analyze the opportunities for optimal business creation in a city, the ML techniques require neighborhood and postal code data.  As will be discussed more fully in the Methodology section below, the algorithm will use FourSquare (foursquare.com) to download Latitude and Longitude information.  Additionally, the algorithm will download the nearest 100 existing business within 500 meters of the Latitude and Longitude by postal code.  To utilize the FourSquare algorithms to retrieve city data, see the Battle of Neighborhoods Jupyter Notebook [link](https://github.com/jcrooker/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Week4Part1.ipynb).\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "We use the neighborhood data for New York and Toronto to identify the neighborhoods with the most *diverse* mix of broad category venues.  We posit that this broadly diverse areas of the city attract the most consumers.  In a feedback loop, consumers likely choose to locate in and around these areas.  This suggests that new business openings in these areas will likely be considered by the largest swath of potential consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is true, these areas with highly diverse venues are also likely the most competitive.  As they are highly competitive, the profit margins from any new market entrant are likely to be constrained.  Ideally, we seek to identify a broad category venue type that is *underprovided* in an otherwise highly diverse community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the diversity of broad category venues in a neighborhood, we calculate the neighborhoods Entropy index with respect to broad category venue types.  That is, we define\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(p)=-pln(p),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is a $k\\times1$ vector with each element $i$ measuring the proportion of venues in that neighborhood that are in broad category $i$.  The neighborhood with the largest Entropy index is interpreted as the most diverse neighborhood and consequently, most attractive, *ceteris paribus*.  The neighborhood with the smallest Entropy index is interpreted as the least diverse and least attractive, *ceteris paribus*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each neighborhood, we also calculate the attractiveness of opening a business in the neighborhood.  This is done using a *cross-entropy* formulazation.  The cross-entropy formulazation allows us to consider a *benchmark* for product offerings in a neighborhood.  For New York, we found that 53.44% of all Venue broad category types were 'Dining'.  Thus, our benchmark in a neighborhood is for up to 53.44% of all Venues to be in this 'Dining' type.  If there are **fewer** than 53.44% of Venues in a neighborhood in this type, we consider it a potential opportunity to open a new 'Dining' venue in this neighborhood.  If more than 53.44% of Venues in this neighborhood are in this 'Dining' category, we consider the neighborhood as oversaturated in 'Dining' establishments and would avoid opening 'Dining' category venues in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the *Cross-Entropy* is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(p/b)=-(p/b)ln(p/b),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is used precisely as above and $b$ is the cities *benchmark* proportion of venues in each of the categories.  For each of New York and Toronto, we order the neighborhoods from largest to smallest in terms of the Cross-Entropy.  The most attractive venue categories for new business starts are the venue categories such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial C(p/b)}{\\partial p}=-[ln(p/b)-1]/b$$\n",

The number of *Bars and Adult Entertainment* venues is somewhat overdeveloped at 10.71% versus the benchmark 9.61%.  All other categories are either unrepresented or underdeveloped in Ravenswood.  This suggests some opportunities for entrepreneurial expansion."

    "The goal of this analysis was to develop a ML technique to recognize business expansion opportunities in major cities.  As we must keep in mind that regional variations likely exist across populations, we should not expect business opportunities in city A transfer directly to city B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our techniques are likely well-suited to identify these regional variations in consumer tastes and preferences.  This is because the introduced technique utilizes the overall business structure of the city to establish a baseline for venues in a neighborhood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With these regional variations accounted for in identifying opportunities, the algorithm quantifies the degree of opportunity by neighborhood.  This allows us to quickly identify the neighborhoods with the greatest degree of underrepresented venues while simultaneously ensuring that a substantial venue infrastructure exists to attract consumers to the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of these techniques is that they allow the entrpreneur to quickly focus in and identify the optimal business opportunities in a city while taking into account regional differences in tastes and preferences.  This is likely particularly advantagous to an organization considering multiple cities including unfamiliar cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analysis above, we identified Ravenswood, New York as possessing substantial expansion opportunities.  In Toronto, we identified Central Bay Street as providing opportunities to introduce venues with pent up demand."
